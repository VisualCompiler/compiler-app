# Visual Compiler 
is a web-application to help students and enthusiasts explore compiler concepts in an interactive, user-friendly way. The app guides users through the five main compiler stages with clear visualizations. At each step, users can see how C source code is transformed into lower-level representations, supported by visualizations of memory and stack operations in the last step. The application is powered by a compiler for a subset of the C programming language. The focus is mainly on fundamental operations, control-flow mechanisms, and function calls. Users can write their own code or experiment with pre-defined examples organized in structured folders.
