# Visual Compiler

is a web-application to help students and enthusiasts explore compiler concepts in an interactive, user-friendly way. The app guides users through the five main compiler stages with clear visualizations. At each step, users can see how C source code is transformed into lower-level representations, supported by visualizations of memory and stack operations in the last step. The application is powered by a compiler for a subset of the C programming language. The focus is mainly on fundamental operations, control-flow mechanisms, and function calls. Users can write their own code or experiment with pre-defined examples organized in structured folders.

### Supported Language Features:

- Unary Operation.
- Binary, Logical and Relational Operations.
- Local Variables.
- If Statements and Conditional Expressions.
- Compound Statements.
- Loops.
- Functions.

### Optimizations

The compiler supports machine-independent optimizations applied to each function of the program, including:

- Constant Folding
- Copy Propagation
- Dead Store Elimination
- Unreachable Block Elimination
